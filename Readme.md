# Logistic Regression From Scratch (No sklearn)

This project implements **Logistic Regression from scratch** using only **NumPy and Matplotlib**.
No machine learning libraries like `sklearn` are used.

The model predicts the **probability of heart disease** based on age using the **sigmoid function**, **log loss**, and **gradient descent**.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Predict whether a person has **heart disease (1)** or **no heart disease (0)** based on age.

- Input: Age  
- Output: Binary classification (0 or 1)
